Welcome to the repository for my personal website [nathan.rs](nathan.rs), built entirely in Rust using the Dioxus framework. This website is a showcase of modern front-end development techniques using Rust, leveraging the power of WebAssembly.

## Overview

I rewrote my website using Rust to explore the benefits of WebAssembly and experience the versatility of the Rust language for front-end development. This repository contains the full source code of my website, highlighting the use of Rust frameworks and my interaction with various JS libraries.

## Features

- **Rust-powered Front-end**: Using Dioxus, a powerful Rust framework, to provide a fluid experience.
- **Interactions with JS Libraries**: Integration with JavaScript code and libraries directly from Rust.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utilizing TailwindCSS for efficient styling.
- **Custom Syntax Highlighting**: Integration with highlight.js for custom code block styling.
- **Hosted on Github Pages**: Utilizes Github Pages for hosting the static web app.

## How to Build

1. Ensure Rust and Cargo are installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Navigate to the directory: `cd <REPO_NAME>`
4. Build and run the project: `dx serve`

Visit `https://localhost:8080/` to view the site locally.
