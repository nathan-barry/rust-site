                This website is that attempt. The frontend rust ecosystem has come a long way in the last few years, and we are at a point where some are now faster than React. While rewriting the site won't let me anything I couldn't do before, it does make working on it much more fun. I've never been a fan of TypeScript or JS but have always loved Rust. In addition to being more enjoyable to code in, any Rust code I write for other personal projects, I can compile and display on this site via web assembly. Further down, we'll take a close look at how I made Conway's Game of Life and got it to run here.

                All of these Rust frontend libraries are very new and share the same characteristics as any frontier. There is usually poor documentation. Sometimes things just don't work. At times you'll spend 6 hours on something just to throw it out. On the otherhand, the codebase is 'small' enough to where one man can comprehend it. You can be the trailblazer that leads the path for others. If I have time, I'll contribute to this library and help tell others what I have learned."

                ". It was this or Leptos, but I chose Dioxus because it had support for desktop applications and mobile apps. One thing that is important to mention is that Dioxus has multiple ways to host a site.

                They have "
                code { "dioxus_web" }
                ", which is like your SPA (Single Page Appcilation) React app. SPAs work by sending over a large bundle of JavaScript and renders the website client side. This gives a very fluid experience but is bad for SEO relatively poor initial load times.

                They also have "
                code { "dioxus_liveview" } 
                ", which to my knowledge renders everthing server side and uses websockets to stream the server content to the client. This is good for real time multiparty apps like a live whiteboard or google docs.

                Finally, they have "
                code {"dioxus-fullstack"}
                " which does SSR (Server Side Rendering). This means that they render the HTML serverside and send it to the client, as opposed to sending JS to render it client side as with dioxus_web.

                I chose "
                code {"dioxus_web"} 
                " mainly since github pages only supports static web apps; no support for SSR sites. I'm also familiar with React, and as we know, old habits die hard.

                Now that we've covered that, let's go through the basics."

                "Above is the bare-bones stripped down version of my site. If you're familiar with React or Next.js, the above should look very familiar.

                Snippet 1 contains two things. The first is a macro that supresses warnings about snake case. Normally for functions we use snake_case, but in the React ecosystem, we tend to use PascalCase for components. The second thing is just the imports. For external crates, we have dioxus and dioxus router. The imports below it are just two other pages I made in different files.

                Snippet 2 consists of the router. It is pretty self explanatory. The only thing of note is that the last one is the catch all route. Any URL that doesn't pattern match with the ones above it will be directed to this custom 404 page.

                Snippet 3 consists of the home page component I made. The base URL will route to and render this component. Dioxus uses RSX, but they do have an html macro that allows you to write a more familiar JSX. You can tell that I'm also using TailwindCSS which we'll talk about later.

                Snippet 4 is just the entree point for the web app. The function app() renders the router which is rendered by main. It's just boiler plate you should keep in main.rs.

                Dioxus also has it's own CLI tool that makes serving super easy. You just run " code {"dx serve"} " to host it locally. It should say to open "
                code { "https://localhost:8080/"}
                " to view the site. You can read more about how to get started with Dioxus "
